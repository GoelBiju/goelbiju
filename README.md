I am an undergraduate Computer Science student and software engineer, currently studying at the University of Plymouth.

This is where I put most of my coding related work and anything interesting I decide to build.

### What am I doing right now?

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Visualising Optimisation Data](https://github.com/GoelBiju/Visualising-Optimisation-Data)

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on [MJSSA Digital Library](https://github.com/MJSSA/digital-library-mobile)
